*Project title*: Synthetic image detection and evasion
*Project objective*: 


What are the current limits to synthetic image detection? Which properties of a synthetic image make it difficult to detect? The project takes up the question synthetic image detection and evasion of images. It seeks to define the image qualities and online environments that best enable detection. The qualities may be image format, size and compression (to mention some) and the online environment could be a platform, engine or other web environment where they are sourced. Taken together we aim to not only define the ideal qualities of a synthetic image for its detection but also the platforms that best assist with that detection, so to speak, or make detection more difficult. That is, there are also qualities (combined with certain environments) that make detection particularly challenging. 

In order to answer these questions, we create or source one or more data sets of known synthetic images with a variety of qualities and sourced from a series of platforms. We seek the combination of qualities and environments that make detection straightforward as well as those that make detection particularly fraught. The research output is a combinatorial analysis, which seeks to determine the sets of characteristics overall that enable detection or evasion.
